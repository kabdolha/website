A lot of time peers ask me how I take notes, what I suggest, what tools I use, what I automate etc.Unfortunately any answer I provide fails to provide lasting value as it's my note taking system. It works for me. It was emergent from years of trying things, adapting them, and taking portions of certain processes and putting them together.But even more so, it's adaptive to my current interests and focus. When I first started taking many more notes I started using PARA because I wasn't able to find a structure that was clear to me where notes went. When I wanted to create and write I introduced Zettelkasten because I was unable to work backwards from an end result. These tools are more useful within the context of your needs rather than some holy aggregate of the best techniques around.This extends to tooling. Obsidian, bear, evernote, M365, these all can provide value depending on what you need. A comparison on which is the best will never work. A comparison of features will always work.The key insight is this: I recommend continuously learning and experiencing new systems, testing them, and implementing the parts that do work while throwing out the parts that don't. That frankestein you create is the perfect note taking system.My note taking system is formed from a combination of experience and my goals. I want to create technical content, I want to make novel emergent content that isn't restating things without adding something new. I also want to take notes in a way that could be useful to myself in the future, even small insights or thoughts. I don't want to feel restricted by any processes, when I hit motivation to write or learn, I don't want to remember my tagging system or make connections to old notes.Reduce FrictionNo complexsystemsNo expectationof orderlynessNavigableEmergentContentNew writingMy Note TakingSystemIdentifyknowledge gapsGoalsRequirementsOrganizationCreationProcessingSystem\nAfter you know your goals and requirements you can create the following:\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Organizing Notes\" data-href=\"Organizing Notes\" href=\"2-areas/clouds/organizing-notes.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">An organization system</a>\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Emergent Note Taking\" data-href=\"Emergent Note Taking\" href=\"2-areas/clouds/emergent-note-taking.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">A note creation system</a>\nA note processing system\nThese should all aim to achieve the goals of your note taking\nThis is how I come across things like Zettelkasten and PARA.

Otherwise you run the risk of being repetitive from the content you consume. Typically ideas come from reading content anyway, but when we fail to capture that we also fail to capture the nuance of our insights.This is where using a Zettelkasten system can provide value. The idea here is to be intentional about rewording insights from other sources to 1. ensure you're paying attention and 2. begin introducing perspective to the content you consume. After creating enough of these atomic notes, you may find you've realized some new connections and from that you can create structured notes. These structured notes aim to be wholly new ideas seeded from inspiration you've consumed.The biggest value I've found it provide is it challenges me to specifically word out and decide what I'm learning or seeing as I connect dots rather than moving backwards from an idea. When you start with an idea, there is no structure or clarity of where that came from or why you believe it should be making new content.\nIdea????ContentSourceSourceSourceInsightIf you base your ideas off of moments or sudden \"eureka\" moments, you risk recreating content you've consumed in the past. The core insights you believe you're providing become muddy. What's your idea and what's someone elses? And then you need to go back and find sources to fill out gaps to make your idea more concrete. This isn't an awful way of doing it, but you're putting the car before the horse and over invest in ideas before they've fully formed.\nIdeaSourceSourceInsightContent\nZettelkasten encourages a structured note-taking experience that I find avoids these pitfalls. Ideas don't pop up from no where, their origins become distinct and tangible. By writing notes you consume in your own words, it's clear what's your insight and what is just a rewording of other's content. When you have an idea, you need to intentionally connect the dots or take a leap from an existing note. You don't write reactively, you write proactively. And instead of filling gaps you start with a mostly formed insight as you lead into new content creation.\n<a data-href=\"Molecular Zettelkasten\" href=\"2-areas/droplet/molecular-zettelkasten.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Molecular Zettelkasten</a>\n<br><a data-href=\"Zettelkasten Note Taking\" href=\"2-areas/droplet/zettelkasten-note-taking.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Zettelkasten Note Taking</a> <br><a data-href=\"Developing a Note Taking Systems\" href=\"2-areas/clouds/developing-a-note-taking-systems.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Developing a Note Taking Systems</a>\n<br><a data-href=\"Why Note Taking Fails\" href=\"2-areas/clouds/why-note-taking-fails.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Why Note Taking Fails</a>\n","aliases":["Processing Notes"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/cloud"],"headers":[{"heading":"Insight or Idea","level":2,"id":"Insight_or_Idea_0"},{"heading":"Supporting Droplets","level":2,"id":"Supporting_Droplets_0"},{"heading":"Connections","level":2,"id":"Connections_0"}],"links":["2-areas/droplet/molecular-zettelkasten.html","2-areas/droplet/zettelkasten-note-taking.html","2-areas/clouds/developing-a-note-taking-systems.html","2-areas/clouds/why-note-taking-fails.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"2-areas/clouds/emergent-note-taking.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1760144602284,"modifiedTime":1760148565742,"sourceSize":2625,"sourcePath":"2-Areas/Clouds/Emergent Note Taking.md","exportPath":"2-areas/clouds/emergent-note-taking.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":["2-areas/clouds/organizing-notes.html","2-areas/clouds/developing-a-note-taking-systems.html","1-projects/storm/my-note-taking-system-(wip).html"],"type":"markdown"},"2-areas/clouds/organizing-notes.html":{"title":"Organizing Notes","icon":"","description":"There are more in depth reasons why PARA may be a good method but this insight is specifically why it works for me and my needs.I use PARA to reduce friction by flattening out folder structures.

However in terms of gaining insights or creating new ideas, this still doesn't really encourage that, it leads to lots of notes being taken but not a lot of ideas being generated or connections being made.\n<a data-href=\"PARA Organization\" href=\"2-areas/droplet/para-organization.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">PARA Organization</a> <br><a data-href=\"Learning and Productivity Frameworks\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Learning and Productivity Frameworks</a>\n<br><a data-href=\"Emergent Note Taking\" href=\"2-areas/clouds/emergent-note-taking.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Emergent Note Taking</a>\n<br><a data-href=\"Why Note Taking Fails\" href=\"2-areas/clouds/why-note-taking-fails.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Why Note Taking Fails</a>\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/cloud"],"headers":[{"heading":"Insight or Idea","level":2,"id":"Insight_or_Idea_0"},{"heading":"Supporting Droplets","level":2,"id":"Supporting_Droplets_0"},{"heading":"Connections","level":2,"id":"Connections_0"}],"links":["2-areas/droplet/para-organization.html",".html","2-areas/clouds/emergent-note-taking.html","2-areas/clouds/why-note-taking-fails.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"2-areas/clouds/organizing-notes.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1760145310956,"modifiedTime":1760147738375,"sourceSize":2434,"sourcePath":"2-Areas/Clouds/Organizing Notes.md","exportPath":"2-areas/clouds/organizing-notes.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":["2-areas/clouds/developing-a-note-taking-systems.html","1-projects/storm/my-note-taking-system-(wip).html"],"type":"markdown"},"2-areas/clouds/why-note-taking-fails.html":{"title":"Why Note Taking Fails","icon":"","description":"We create and consume notes in different ways. Why do we take notes? This will be different for everyone but a few common reasons are: recall, discovery of new ideas, connections, helping you think about content you consume, and creating content.\nNotesYouCreate- Unstructured- Chaotic- Disconnected- RapidYouConsume- Grouped- Tagged- Structured- Well paced- SearchableNotes\nFundamentally you will always have an easier time creating notes one way and consuming them another way. This isn't new information this is why note taking systems and tools emerge. Obsidian is a famous tool for this as it simplifies connecting disparate ideas in the hopes of emerging content, connections, and recallThe problem is obsidian doesn't do that for you, it can't. It provides tools to enable this like connections, tagging, filters, grouping, embedding and so on. Ideally once done, it should be quite easy to go back through your notes.\nRawNotesYouProcessedNotesTagGroupFilterFilter1-4x the effort of the original note takingConsume\nHowever, these systems can take as long as or longer than creating the original notes. They also require attentiveness and discipline in a single framework. In my experience the way you think or like to read changes not only over time but from subject to subject making this inherently unsustainable unless you dedicate massive amounts of time to organization alone.Due to this many note taking solutions fail.\n<a data-href=\"PARA Method\" href=\"3-resources/para-method.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">PARA Method</a>\n<br><a data-href=\"Zettelkasten Note Taking\" href=\"2-areas/droplet/zettelkasten-note-taking.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Zettelkasten Note Taking</a>\n<br><a data-href=\"Molecular Zettelkasten\" href=\"2-areas/droplet/molecular-zettelkasten.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Molecular Zettelkasten</a> <br><a data-href=\"Developing a Note Taking Systems\" href=\"2-areas/clouds/developing-a-note-taking-systems.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Developing a Note Taking Systems</a> Is there anything to back up how people consume and write differently?\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/cloud"],"headers":[{"heading":"Insight or Idea","level":2,"id":"Insight_or_Idea_0"},{"heading":"Supporting Droplets","level":2,"id":"Supporting_Droplets_0"},{"heading":"Connections","level":2,"id":"Connections_0"},{"heading":"Open Questions","level":2,"id":"Open_Questions_0"}],"links":["3-resources/para-method.html","2-areas/droplet/zettelkasten-note-taking.html","2-areas/droplet/molecular-zettelkasten.html","2-areas/clouds/developing-a-note-taking-systems.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"2-areas/clouds/why-note-taking-fails.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1760140613688,"modifiedTime":1760148756508,"sourceSize":1690,"sourcePath":"2-Areas/Clouds/Why Note Taking Fails.md","exportPath":"2-areas/clouds/why-note-taking-fails.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":["2-areas/clouds/organizing-notes.html","2-areas/clouds/developing-a-note-taking-systems.html","2-areas/clouds/emergent-note-taking.html","1-projects/storm/my-note-taking-system-(wip).html"],"type":"markdown"},"2-areas/droplet/molecular-zettelkasten.html":{"title":"Molecular Zettelkasten","icon":"","description":"This is Wanderlootes expansion of zettlekasten for a digital note taking system like obsidian.
